Therefore, it is highly related with the $F_0$ of a speech signal, which refers to the approximate frequency of the (quasi-)periodic structure of speech signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "The oscillation originates from the vocal folds, which oscillate in the airflow when appropriately tensed. The fundamental frequency is defined as the average number of oscillations per second and expressed in Hertz. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the oscillation originates from an organic structure, it is not exactly periodic but contains significant fluctuations. In particular, amount of variation in period length and amplitude are known respectively as jitter and shimmer. Moreover, it changes constantly within the sentence and can be used for emphasis or for questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the pitch and the $F_0$ are not the same, because the pitch is defined as our perception of fundamental frequency. Therefore, for complex sounds like speech, it can differ from $F_0$ due to overtones.\n",
